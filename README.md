Hangout Whispher for Google+
============================

September 20th 2011, the Google Hangouts API was released, and I was the first
developer that released an app which I called Multiple Conversations. Original

It has now been renamed to Hangout Whisper for Google+, you can control the
local video and audio levels for a participant in a hangout.

For example, say you want to talk to person in a hangout that has 10 people,
but there are many people talking on top of you, you can mute everyone except
the displayed active user.

Another neat feature is muting everything in the hangout, to do that, just select
yourself and activate the whisper and your done.

Please fork and contribute code! I hope you get to learn about the API and you 
will be able to develop your own awesome hangout apps!

Thanks to the following awesome people who helped me test it!
